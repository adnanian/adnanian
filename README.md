## 👋 Hi! My Name is Adnan Wazwaz

I'm a full stack software engineer, who specializes in the development and deployment of web and mobile applications. My sectors of focus are retail and education.

🔭 I'm currently freelancing and collaborating with others on various projects.

🌱 I'm currently learning TypeScript and perfecting my CSS, as well as researching a variety of topics such as DevOps and technical writing.

⚡ I'm also passionate about the Arabic language (specifically Fusha or Classical/Modern Standard).

🤔 I'm actively seeking help testing out my latest application, Easy Itemizer (more on that below), a live, full stack inventory mangement system.

📫 You can reach out to me on [<img alt="linkedin" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" />](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adnan-wazwaz-09aa1b2b7/) or [my personal website](https://adnan-wazwaz.netlify.app/) for further inquires.
